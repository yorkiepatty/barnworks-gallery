AlphaVox - Simplified Speech Recognition
--------------------------------------
This module provides a simplified speech recognition implementation that can be
easily integrated with web browsers using JavaScript's Web Speech API.

It includes:
- Server-side speech processing
- Integration with conversation engine
- Error handling for various speech recognition scenarios
